# WebOps

Hi this is Shubham Kumar Jha, a sopho from MnC branch and this my submission for Task 2.

This submission features a Weather website, which gets the location of the user using JS Geolocation feature and further uses the returned coordinates
in APIs to get the city name and the weather conditions of that coordinates.
Also the website is now RESPONSIVE and thus fit for all screen sizes.
