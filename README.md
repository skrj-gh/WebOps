# WebOps

Hi this is Shubham Kumar Jha, a sopho from MnC branch and this my submission for Task 3.
This submission features a Django based website, which hosts a simple website that shows
how we can navigate to different pages and links inside a website.
I have tried to use as much django based features as possile(such as "url" instead of href="" for links) to make it more efficient.
